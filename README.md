## Stack used

1. Javascript for the back-end
2. CSS for the styling
3. HTML for a seamless web interface
4. Open Trivia API to retrieve questions for the quiz.
5. Git Pages to deploy the project

it was imparative for us to use a language we're both familiar with(Javascript) whilst trying 2 other languages we're trying to be skilled on(HTML and CSS)
